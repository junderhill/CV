# Jason Underhill

I am a hard working individual who is focused and outgoing with a passion for software development and desire to continually improve my skills. I strive to produce clean, maintainable code in a pragmatic approach.

I continue to develop my technical skills outside of work and like to work on some open source and personal software development projects when time allows. Away from software development I'm also a keen photographer and avid outdoor enthusiast, enjoying walking, climbing, wild camping amongst other things.
